# TODO List
- [ ] go through my lazy_kickstart, remove things I don't want
- [X] add lsps that I would use like one for C++
- [X] customize the theme, I want the bg to be the same as my terminal
- [X] UPDATE: starting to grow on me :P. I don't like gcc to comment lines, i would prefer ctrl + '/'
- [X] I liked in NvChad setup when I had the option to open like a file tree (nice for adding/removing/deleting files)
- [X] UPDATE: Growing on me... The drop down on the suggestions from lsp look a lil funky, I think if I can make the bg of it a solid color not transparent it would look better, however its not a big deal
- [X] Add auto brace

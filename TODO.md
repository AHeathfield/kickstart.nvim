# TODO List
- [ ] go through my lazy_kickstart, remove things I don't want
- [X] add lsps that I would use like one for C++
- [X] customize the theme, I want the bg to be the same as my terminal
- [ ] I don't like gcc to comment lines, i would prefer ctrl + '/'
- [ ] I liked in NvChad setup when I had the option to open like a file tree (nice for adding/removing/deleting files)
